### The Lowdown

This document isn't a list of flat rules, and it isn't meant to restrict people from acting in certain ways. What it is instead is a general document of how we as a community want you to act when you're part of us, whether contributor or just someone participating.

We have only one rule: **don't be a dick.** We're all here because of a shared passion, and only when we all see eye-to-eye can we make the most of that. There'll be disagreements, and you won't always feel civil, but please try to respect other peoples' viewpoints. Nothing about anyone matters - their gender, their religion, whatever - here, and you're expected to act like it. If you're a constant jerk across multiple threads, don't expect to be welcome here.

That's all. Have a fun time here, and treat people like you (ideally) want to be treated by being kind to each other.
