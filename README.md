# Cataclysm: Aftershock

Cataclysm: Aftershock - or just Aftershock - is a turn-based, permadeath roguelike game set in the wake of a global disaster in the near future resulting in the downfall of modern civlization. As one of the few surviving humans left in the world, you'll improvise tools from scraps, pillage the remains of cities and towns to find supplies, and carve a live for yourself amongst the ashes. Along the way, you might find hallmarks of the old civilization: nuclear cars, cybernetic implants, and, perhaps, in the dusty and forgotten halls of a science laboratory, answers to why all this happened.

Zombies, military robots gone rogue, feral wildlife, radioactive insects, and alien horrors now roam the Earth, each wanting nothing more than to snuff out the remains of civilization. Scavenge alone, or band together with other survivors; establish a fortified foothold, or fix up a car with welding equipment and roam the landscape as a nomad. Whatever you choose, the planet continues to fall apart, and you get the feeling that the aftershocks of this disaster are yet to end...

## Information

Aftershock is a forked variant of the game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. Though both projects are driven by passion, and have the same overall goals, Dark Days Ahead takes a far more simulationist approach, prioritizing realism above all else, sometimes as the expense of fun gameplay.

Aftershock aims to take the other route; there exist very hard sci-fi elements, as well as abilities to do certain things that would make little or no sense in the real world. The general guideline for Aftershock is game balance, rather than simulation of the real world.

As of right now, there are four guidelines for a change:
* Is it interesting and balanced?
* Does it make sense on paper, with no logic applied? (Example: A t-shirt, plus a waterproof sheet, equals a waterproof t-shirt!)
* Is it not magic, or is at least explained by in-universe technology?
* Does the game add to existing gameplay rather than removing it for a reason such as realism or difficulty? If it's a balance change, is it warranted in the eyes of the community?

If all of these things are met, your change is probably good to go! Keep in mind that the ultimate fate of a change is determined by the community, and by the maintainers of the repository. We try to be lenient, but some things just won't fly. Use common sense, and feel free to call our bullshit if we don't adhere to it.

## Download

Every day, as long as there's been changes since the previous one, there's a daily build released on the Releases section. The format followed is as follows - here's an example:

Y1D3

Y1, or Year 1, is an allusion to in-game years, not actual years. The year numbers represent major updates. D3, or Day 3, represents the build number or minor version. This can extend beyond actual years; for instance, Y0D503 is daily build 503 of major update 0.
