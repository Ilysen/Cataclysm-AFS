    "description": "Assembled from a set of instructions you found in an old book of DIY projects, the *FOODCO kitchen buddy* claims to be *the perfect solution to all your home-cooking needs!*.  While it is surprisingly handy for vacuum-sealing as well as dehydrating food, the cheery sales pitch neglected to mention A - how awkward the damn thing is, B - That you still need a normal kitchen and C - how it doesn't take batteries.  You're going to have to weld it to a vehicle, or something else with a supply of electricity, if you want to use it.  In addition to the food preservation features, it also has a food processor, a water-purification system, a drawer for holding extra tools, and for some insane reason, a press and die set for hand-loading ammunition."
